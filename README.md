# TriviaGame
i must be honest-i straight up ran out of time to do a proper readme, but will finish after this homework is submitted. i tried to spice up the timed trivia game by adding sounds to timed events, randomizing the appearance of answers, preventing questions from being asked twice in a round, and asking questions with musical and visual clues. hope y'all enjoy playing!
